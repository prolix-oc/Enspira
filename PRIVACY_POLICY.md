## Introduction  
Enspira ("**Enspira**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**") is an AI chatbot framework that lets users create chatbots for Twitch and other platforms. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data. We have written this policy in a reader-friendly tone without compromising legal accuracy, so you can understand our practices clearly.

Enspira abides by global data protection laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**), the California Consumer Privacy Act (**CCPA**) (as amended by the CPRA), the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (**COPPA**), and similar laws worldwide (for example, Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, or **LGPD**, which closely mirrors GDPR’s rights). In other words, no matter where you live, we aim to handle your data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. By using Enspira’s services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect  
We only collect personal information that is necessary to provide and improve the Enspira service. This includes:

- **Account Information:** When you create an Enspira account, we collect information you provide during sign-up, such as your name, username, email address, and password. This information identifies you on our platform and allows us to communicate with you (for example, sending service updates or responding to support requests). We may also assign an account ID internally. If you choose to provide additional profile details, those are optional and visible only as configured.

- **Integration Credentials (Tokens and API Keys):** If you integrate Enspira with third-party services (like Twitch, Discord, etc.), we will ask for access tokens, API keys, or other credentials necessary to connect with those services. For example, you might provide your Twitch bot token so Enspira can read and post chat messages on your behalf. We **store these tokens securely** (using encryption) and use them **only internally** to power the integration features you enable. These credentials are never shared with or visible to other users or any external parties, and we do **not** use them for any purpose unrelated to providing the Enspira service (we will never use your tokens for marketing or outside data mining). 

- **Real-Time Chat and Voice Data:** Enspira collects content from real-time interactions on platforms where your chatbot is active. This can include text chat messages in Twitch or similar chatrooms, and any vocal/audio interactions routed through the service (for instance, if Enspira integrates with a voice chat or transcribes spoken questions). We store these messages and audio data on Enspira’s secure infrastructure to enable the chatbot’s functionality (e.g. to generate responses, moderate content, or analyze context). **Participating Users** – i.e. individuals who interact with the chatbot on third-party platforms – should be aware that their public messages or voice inputs may be processed and temporarily stored by Enspira. This data **is not shared with any third parties**; it remains within the Enspira system and is accessible only to the streamer/admin who deployed the bot and our service (as needed for processing). For example, if someone in your Twitch chat says "Hello bot!", Enspira will record that message internally so the bot can respond, but we do not publish or sell that chat log. Voice data (if any) is treated similarly and may be transcribed for the bot’s understanding, but the recordings or transcripts aren’t disclosed externally. We retain chat and voice logs primarily to improve responses and for your review/debugging, and you can request their deletion as described below.

- **Inferred Information and Preferences:** Through the use of our AI, Enspira may analyze interactions to infer certain information, such as user preferences, attitudes, or behavior patterns. For instance, the chatbot might internally tag a Participating User as enjoying certain game genres based on their questions, or mark certain topics as sensitive for that user. These **inferences and internal notes** are generated to personalize and improve the chatbot’s performance (for example, to tailor responses or avoid topics a user dislikes). All such inferred data remains **internal to Enspira** – we do **not** share or sell profiles of users or these preference indicators to anyone. They are used only by our system and (if applicable) visible to the chatbot owner in an aggregate or summary form (e.g. "Top topics your audience asked about this week"). This inferred data is considered part of the user’s data and is protected under this Policy.

- **Payment and Subscription Information:** Enspira offers premium features or subscriptions which may require payment. We **do not collect or store your full payment card details** on our servers. Payments are handled by trusted third-party payment processors such as Stripe and PayPal. When you make a purchase, you will provide your payment information (credit card number, billing info, etc.) directly to those payment processors, who then share with us only the information needed to record your subscription (e.g. your name, contact info, the fact that you subscribed, payment confirmation, and perhaps a truncated card number or transaction ID). Enspira itself **never has access to your full credit card number or banking details**. All we retain is a record of your purchase (such as the subscription plan, start and end date, and status) and the information that the payment processor provides for our accounting (which may include your name, email, and partial card details like last 4 digits, but never the full payment data). These payment processors are PCI-DSS compliant and have their own privacy policies governing your payment data. If you have questions about how your payment information is handled, please refer to Stripe’s or PayPal’s privacy policies. In short, Enspira ensures that your financial information is kept safe by deferring to industry-standard payment services; we simply keep track of what you’ve purchased.

- **Device and Usage Data:** Like most online services, we automatically collect some technical information when you use Enspira. This includes log data such as your IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, and timestamps of when you accessed the service. We may also note how you interact with our website or dashboard (e.g. UI clicks or pages visited) for improving our user interface. Additionally, we use cookies or similar technologies on our website to remember your login session and preferences. These cookies are only used for functionality and authentication, not for advertising purposes. Device and usage data are collected to **ensure the security and proper functioning** of the service (for example, to detect fraudulent use or to prevent unauthorized access), and to analyze and improve performance (like monitoring if our servers are responding quickly). This technical data is generally not tied to your identity for marketing – it’s used internally and is not shared with advertisers. 

**Summary of What We Don’t Collect:** We do **not** intentionally collect any sensitive personal data such as your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health information, or biometric identifiers, unless you explicitly provide such information in a chat interaction. We also do not solicit or knowingly collect information from third-party sources about you – all data is either provided by you or generated through your use of Enspira. If we ever need to collect additional categories of personal information, we will update this Privacy Policy and, if required by law, obtain your consent.

## How We Use Your Information  
Enspira uses the collected information for the following purposes, and **only** for these purposes:

- **Providing and Maintaining the Service:** We use your information to operate the Enspira platform and deliver our chatbot services. This includes using integration tokens to connect to third-party platforms (e.g., logging the bot into Twitch chat), processing chat and voice data so the AI chatbot can understand and respond, and maintaining your account (authenticating you when you log in, saving your bot configurations, etc.). In short, all data from you and your participating users is primarily used to make sure the chatbot works as intended in your communities.

- **Improving Enspira’s AI and Features:** We continually work to improve our AI models, responses, and platform features. Enspira may use chat logs, voice transcripts, and other interaction data to refine our algorithms and train our language models. **Importantly, before using logs for development or training, we **strip or anonymize any personal identifiers (PII)** from the data.** For example, if a chat message included a username or real name, we would remove or generalize it. The training process might involve aggregated, anonymized conversation data to help the AI learn to respond better. This usage is **internal** – we do not share raw data with any external researchers or companies. The improved AI model does not output your personal information; it simply learns to be more effective. Data used for training or improvement never goes to any third-party, and we do not include any sensitive personal details in this process. By improving our AI with user interactions, we can enhance response accuracy, language understanding, and create new features (like better moderation filters), all without compromising your privacy.

- **Internal Analytics and Metrics:** We may analyze usage patterns, such as the number of messages processed, peak activity times, or common commands used, to understand how our service is performing and what features are most popular. This helps us make data-driven decisions on where to focus improvements. These analytics are typically done on aggregated data (not looking at specific user identities) and are used internally. For example, knowing that "X% of Enspira bots get voice input" might encourage us to improve voice recognition. If we generate any reports or insights, they will not contain personal details of any individual user or chat participant.

- **Communication with You:** We use contact information (like your email address) to send you service-related communications. These include confirmations (e.g., when you sign up or make a payment), important announcements about the service (like updates to this Privacy Policy or security notices), and customer support responses if you reach out to us. We might also send tips or guides on using Enspira if you’re a user, but we will not spam you with marketing emails. If we ever send promotional content, it will be optional and sent only with appropriate consent where required. You can opt out of non-essential communications at any time by contacting us or using an unsubscribe link if provided.

- **Ensuring Security and Preventing Misuse:** Information we collect (especially logs and usage data) may be used to monitor for suspicious or illegal activities on the platform. This helps us protect our users and their communities. For example, we may use automated tools to scan chat content for malware links, spam patterns, or terms indicative of extreme harassment or illegal behavior (like child exploitation content), so that we can take appropriate action (such as alerting the bot owner or disabling a malicious user’s access). We also maintain logs to investigate any technical issues or abuse incidents. If we detect behavior that violates our Terms of Service or is potentially harmful, we may use relevant account or content data to intervene (which could include banning an account, filtering certain content, or contacting authorities as described in **Law Enforcement** below).

- **Legal Compliance:** Where necessary, we will use and disclose information to comply with our legal obligations. This includes retaining certain data to meet record-keeping laws, honoring privacy rights requests you make (using your data to locate and delete other data, for instance), and using your information to respond to lawful requests from government authorities if required (explained later in this Policy). We also use your data to enforce our agreements (e.g., if payments are owed or to enforce our Terms of Service) and to resolve disputes (for instance, using chat records to address a user’s complaint about content).

**No Marketing or Selling of Personal Data:** We want to emphasize that we **do not** use your personal information (or your users’ information) for advertising or marketing targeting. We do not sell or rent personal data to third-party companies for their marketing purposes. In other words, the data you and your community generate is used strictly to run and improve Enspira for your benefit – nothing else. If this ever changes, we would update this Policy and give you the choice to consent or opt-out as required by law.

## Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR Notice)  
For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other regions with similar laws, Enspira must have a valid legal basis to process your personal data. Depending on the context, our legal bases include:

- **Contractual Necessity:** When you sign up for Enspira and agree to our Terms of Service, a contract is formed. We need to process certain personal data to fulfill that contract – namely, to provide you with the chatbot services you requested. For example, we process your account information and integration tokens to deliver the functionality of connecting your bot to Twitch, and we process chat data to generate the responses you expect. Without this data processing, we wouldn’t be able to provide the service. Thus, for registered users, most of our data processing (account management, integrations, communications, etc.) is based on contractual necessity.

- **Legitimate Interests:** We process some data under the doctrine of *legitimate interests*. This means we have assessed that our processing is necessary for purposes that are legitimate (operational or business interests) and that doing so doesn’t override your rights and freedoms. We rely on legitimate interests, for instance, to improve our AI and services (we have a legitimate interest in refining our product using interaction data, and we protect your rights by anonymizing personal info as described). We also rely on legitimate interests to process the data of "Participating Users" in chat rooms – those individuals might not have a direct account with Enspira, but it is in our legitimate interest (and the interest of the chatbot owner and even the participants themselves) to process their public chat messages so that the bot can function and interact. We handle that data responsibly and provide means for those users to exercise their rights. Other examples of legitimate interest include using data for security/fraud prevention, analytics, and administrative purposes. Whenever we process on this basis, we ensure that the processing is what you would reasonably expect in the context of using our service and that it has minimal privacy impact (for example, processing a Twitch chatter’s message is expected if they trigger a bot command).

- **Consent:** In general, we do not rely on consent for most data processing, except in specific situations where consent is legally required or you have a genuine choice. For example, if we ever want to use your data in a way that is not necessary for the service (say, to feature your chatbot’s success story on our blog), we would ask for your consent. Similarly, if we ever process sensitive personal data (which we currently do not), we would obtain explicit consent as required. For children under the age thresholds (see **Children’s Privacy** below), we rely on verifiable parental consent in compliance with COPPA for those under 13, and any consent required under GDPR (parental consent for users under 16 in applicable EU countries). Where we do rely on consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, and we will stop the processing in question.

- **Legal Obligation:** If we are subject to any legal obligations that require processing or disclosing personal data, we will do so as necessary. For instance, data about your transactions might be processed and retained for tax law compliance, or we might process certain information to satisfy a court order or regulatory requirement. In such cases, the law provides the basis for processing.

We will happily explain the specific legal basis for any specific processing of your personal data if you have questions. Our aim is to ensure we always have a sound justification under applicable law for what we do with your data.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure  
Your privacy is extremely important to us. **We do not share your personal information with third parties except in the limited scenarios described here:** 

- **No Selling of Data:** First and foremost, **we do not sell personal data**. In the past 12 months (and since our inception), we have not sold any user’s personal information for monetary gain or otherwise. This includes not selling data of participating users, and we will never do so without explicit permission and compliance with applicable law. The CCPA grants California consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of their information; we affirm that we do not engage in any data sales or sharing for targeted advertising that would trigger this right.

- **Service Providers (Processors):** We use certain trusted third-party companies to help us run Enspira. These service providers *process data on our behalf* and under our instructions. Examples include our cloud hosting provider (which stores our databases and servers), email service (to send out verification or notification emails), and error tracking or analytics tools that help us fix bugs. We only share with them the data that is necessary for them to perform their functions. For instance, our hosting provider will naturally hold the data stored in our systems (including chat logs, etc.) on their servers, but they have no permission to access or use that data for any purpose other than storing it and enabling our service to function. We require all service providers to safeguard your data with security measures and to treat it confidentially. They are **not allowed to use your information for anything outside the scope of providing services to Enspira**. We also ensure that we have appropriate agreements in place (such as Data Processing Addendums) with these providers to uphold GDPR and other privacy requirements.

- **Third-Party Integrations You Authorize:** When you integrate Enspira with external platforms (like Twitch, Discord, YouTube, etc.), there is inherently some flow of information between Enspira and those platforms. For example, if you connect a Twitch bot, Enspira will send and receive chat messages through Twitch’s APIs. This means Twitch will receive any messages the Enspira bot posts (as if you posted them, since the bot uses your token), and Enspira will receive any messages that Twitch sends to it according to the integration (like chat text for processing). Similarly, if Enspira fetches your Twitch username or channel information via the API to set up the bot, that is an exchange of data with Twitch. **However, this type of data exchange is controlled by you and the third-party platform’s own API permissions** – we are not *giving* Twitch any new personal data about you beyond what they already have (you have an account with them and authorized us to act on it), nor are we receiving more from them than necessary. We recommend reviewing the privacy settings and policies of any third-party platforms you integrate with Enspira, as those platforms’ data practices are outside our control. Rest assured that Enspira does not transmit your Enspira-collected data (like your users’ chat habits or your account info) *to* other third parties unless it’s part of the service function you enabled. In short: integration-related sharing only happens to the extent needed to make that integration work, and you’ll be aware of it (for example, chat messages obviously appear on Twitch by design, etc.).

- **Payment Processors:** As noted, if you make payments, the transaction is handled by Stripe, PayPal, or similar processors. Those companies receive the necessary personal data to process the payment (such as your name, credit card info, billing address) directly from you when you complete a purchase on their checkout forms. They do not share your full financial information with us. We may share with them a transaction ID or user ID to tie the payment to your Enspira account, and they in turn tell us if the payment was successful. All such processors are contractually obligated to use your data only for the purpose of processing payments and to comply with applicable privacy/security standards. We do not share any other user data with payment processors beyond what is needed for the transaction (and we don’t receive additional data from them except payment status and minimal details as described). If you request a refund or dispute a charge, we may have to provide the processor with relevant information from our side (e.g., proof that a service was delivered). Those are handled case-by-case in line with their policies and ours.

- **Affiliates and Business Transfers:** Currently, Enspira is operated by a single company/entity and does not have corporate affiliates with whom we share data. If this changes (for example, if we establish a parent or subsidiary company that assists in operations), we would ensure any internal data sharing receives the same level of protection described here, and we would update this Policy. In the event of a future transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of Enspira’s business or assets, user data may be transferred to the new owner as part of that deal. If that happens, we will ensure the new owner is contractually bound to respect your personal data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and we will notify you (for example, via email or a prominent notice on our site) if such a transfer occurs along with any choices you may have. Your privacy will remain a priority in any business transition.

- **Legal Compliance and Protection:** We may disclose personal information outside of Enspira **if required by law or if we believe in good faith that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary** to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request (such as a subpoena or court order), (b) enforce our Terms of Service or investigate potential violations thereof, or (c) detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues. Additionally, if a user is involved in activities that we reasonably suspect to be illegal or harmful (for example, using the service to spread child sexual abuse material, engage in harassment or hate crimes, impersonate someone in a defamatory manner, or commit libel/slander using the bot), we reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement agencies. Such cooperation may involve **preserving chat logs or user data and sharing it with law enforcement** under appropriate legal procedures. We will only do this in strict accordance with applicable laws – for instance, if the law requires a warrant or court order, we will insist that officials go through that legal process. We will also aim to notify the affected user of any law enforcement request *before* we disclose information (to give you an opportunity to object or seek legal protection), unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. See the section on **Law Enforcement & Warrant Canary** for more information on how we handle (and signal) government requests for data.

To summarize, outside of the above circumstances, **no one outside of Enspira’s organization and service providers gets access to your personal data.** We do not share it with advertisers, data brokers, or unrelated parties. Your trust is key, and we have no interest in profiting from your data beyond providing you a great service.

## Data Retention  
**How long does Enspira keep your data?** We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, or as required by law. This means:

- **Account Information** is kept for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account or request deletion, we will remove your account details from our live databases within a reasonable time frame (generally within 30 days, unless a shorter period is required by law). Backup copies might persist for a little longer (we have routine backups to prevent data loss, which are typically overwritten on a rolling basis), but these will be securely stored and eventually deleted as well. If you have not logged into your account for an extended period, we may contact you to ask if you want to maintain it; we won’t delete active accounts without consent, except as needed for legal compliance or policy violations.

- **Integration Tokens** are retained until you revoke the integration or delete your account. You have the ability to disconnect an integrated service at any time (for example, you can revoke Enspira’s access on Twitch or through our dashboard). If you do so, we will delete the stored token. We also periodically update tokens as required (they may expire and get refreshed). We don’t keep historical tokens that are no longer valid beyond short-term logs for security (to investigate misuse if any).

- **Chat and Voice Data** are generally stored for the benefit of the service (such as logs for you to review or for the AI to learn). We currently retain chat logs and voice transcripts on our servers so you can access conversation history and so we can improve the service. If you would like specific chat data to be removed (for example, if a participating user requests that their messages be deleted), we will accommodate such requests as detailed in **Your Rights** below. By default, if you simply stop using Enspira, the chat data remains until your account is deleted, as it is tied to your account’s bot history. We may implement retention limits (like auto-deleting logs after a certain number of months) in the future and will update this Policy if so. Notably, if any chat/voice data is required to be deleted for legal reasons (e.g., a valid erasure request or if we learn it contains unlawful content that must be removed), we will delete it promptly from our systems and request our processors to do the same.

- **Inferred Data and AI Model Data**: Inferred preferences or internal notes associated with user interactions are updated continuously and retained as part of the user’s profile as long as the underlying interaction data is kept. If source data (like a chat message) is deleted, any direct inference drawn solely from that message (like a tag or score) will be removed or anonymized as well. However, please note the special case of data **used to train or improve our AI models**: once personal data is anonymized and incorporated into a training dataset, it becomes part of the AI’s learned knowledge in an aggregated form. We cannot practically extract a single user’s influence from a trained model. Therefore, if you request deletion of data, we will delete the raw data and ensure it’s not used for new training, but we **cannot retroactively remove your data from an already-trained machine learning model**. We want to be transparent that information already integrated into model parameters is irrecoverable in terms of pinpoint removal. That said, such model data is no longer personal or identifiable to you – it’s just mathematical weights and patterns – and it cannot be used to reconstruct your personal information.

- **Transactional Data** (payments): Records of your subscription and payments are kept as long as needed for accounting and legal compliance (for example, financial records may be kept for a number of years as required by tax law). However, this data is minimal (not your card details, just the fact you paid and how much, etc.). If you delete your account, we will disassociate your personal identity from payment records to the extent allowed (for instance, we might keep an invoice ID but not easily link it to your deleted account, except in our financial files which are kept securely and separately).

- **Logs and Backups:** System logs (which may include IP addresses and device information) are generally rotated or deleted within a few months at most, unless we need to retain them longer for security analysis. Backups are typically retained for a limited duration (e.g., encrypted backups on a 30-day rotation), after which they are overwritten or deleted. If data is deleted from the live system, it will be removed from backups in the normal course of the backup cycle.

In all cases, when we no longer have a legitimate need to retain your personal information, we will securely dispose of it. If deletion is not immediately feasible (for example, the data is in an archived backup), we will ensure it remains securely stored and isolated from any further active use until deletion is possible.

## Data Security  
We take the security of your data very seriously. Enspira implements **industry-standard security measures** to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

- **Encryption:** All network communication between your browser (or our bots) and Enspira is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. Sensitive data like authentication tokens, API keys, and passwords are encrypted in our database at rest. We follow best practices for encryption key management and use strong cryptographic protocols to prevent eavesdropping. For example, your password is stored as a salted hash (not in plaintext), and integration tokens are encrypted such that even if someone somehow accessed our database, they could not use the tokens without going through our application’s decryption safeguards.

- **Access Controls:** Within our organization, access to personal data is restricted on a need-to-know basis. Only authorized personnel (for example, a limited subset of the team responsible for server operations or support) can access user data, and even then, only what's necessary for their role. Our staff are trained on confidentiality and are bound by strict agreements to protect user privacy. We also employ role-based access in the software itself — for instance, your account data is accessible to you via login, but not accessible to other users; similarly, one customer’s bot logs cannot be seen by another customer.

- **Security Testing and Auditing:** We regularly monitor our systems for vulnerabilities and attacks. This includes keeping our software and dependencies up-to-date with security patches, performing periodic security audits, and utilizing intrusion detection systems on our network. We may also engage third-party security experts to conduct penetration testing. Our servers are behind firewalls and employ safeguards to limit and log incoming and outgoing access. Any unusual activity triggers alerts for our security team to investigate.

- **Data Minimization:** We only collect the information that we need, which inherently reduces risk. By not stockpiling unnecessary PII and by anonymizing data for AI training, we limit the amount of sensitive information in our environment. Less data means less risk of something valuable being exposed.

- **Physical Security:** Our infrastructure is hosted on reputable cloud platforms that maintain robust physical security of their data centers. This includes 24/7 monitoring, access badges, biometrics, and other controls at the facilities where servers are stored. While we rely on their assurances for physical protection, we choose providers known for high security standards.

- **Backups and Recovery:** We maintain backups in case of system failure, but those backups are encrypted and stored securely. In the event of a disaster or technical issue, we have procedures to restore functionality while preserving data integrity.

Despite all these measures, it’s important to note that **no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure**. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. However, we continuously update and improve our security practices to meet or exceed industry best practices. In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the appropriate authorities as required by law, and we will take immediate steps to mitigate the impact and prevent future occurrences.

We also encourage you to play a role in keeping your data secure. Use a strong, unique password for Enspira, do not share your account credentials with others, and notify us immediately at **team@enspira.tools** if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or any security vulnerability in our Service.

## Children’s Privacy (Underage Users)  
Enspira is committed to protecting the privacy of minors. Our platform can be used by underage users (people under 18 years old), but with important safeguards:

- **COPPA and Under-13 Users:** We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, in compliance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. The Enspira service and its website are not primarily directed to children under 13. If you are under 13, **please do not create an Enspira account or provide any personal information** on our site **without permission from your parent or guardian**. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal data from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take prompt steps to delete that information from our records. For example, if a 12-year-old signs up with a fake birthdate and we later discover the true age, we will deactivate the account and remove the data unless a parent/guardian quickly provides consent for retention (and typically, we would not allow continued use given COPPA’s requirements).

- **Users Between 13 and 18:** Teens (13-17) are allowed to use Enspira, but if you are under 18, you should do so with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian. We encourage parents of teenagers to educate their kids about safe online practices and to monitor their activities on platforms like Enspira. Some jurisdictions (such as EU countries under the GDPR) have **digital age of consent** rules that range from 13 to 16 years. We strive to comply with those rules: if required by applicable law, we will seek parental consent or authorization for processing personal data of minors under the relevant age threshold. Practically, our content and communications are generally appropriate for a general audience, but if you are under 16 in the EU (for example), we may require that your parent/guardian consent to your use of Enspira when you sign up, in accordance with Article 8 of the GDPR and equivalent local laws.

- **No Child-Directed Services:** Enspira’s chatbots on platforms like Twitch are not intended to target or specifically engage children under 13. Twitch itself requires users to be at least 13 years old. We expect that most "participating users" in chats are teenagers or adults, given those platform rules. If an Enspira chatbot is deployed in an environment that *is* child-directed (which is unusual, but for instance, if someone made a chatbot for a kids’ community), the operator of that chatbot is responsible for ensuring compliance with COPPA and other child privacy laws (for example, by obtaining parental consent for kids to interact or by not collecting personal info from kids). Enspira will cooperate with our users to facilitate compliance – for example, we can disable data collection features for a particular bot if it’s necessary to avoid collecting data from children.

- **Parental Rights:** If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child under 18 (especially under 13) has provided personal information to Enspira, please contact us at **team@enspira.tools**. We will be happy to review, update, or delete your child’s information as appropriate. Parents in the U.S. have rights under COPPA, including the right to review any personal information collected from their child, to have it deleted, and to refuse further collection or use of the child’s information. We extend similar rights to parents globally in line with applicable laws.

We aim to treat minors’ data with extra care and never use it for purposes like profiling or marketing. We do not show targeted ads and we do not knowingly allow third parties to track children’s activity on our site. Any information collected from minors is used solely to provide the service and ensure it functions safely and appropriately.

## Your Rights and Choices  
You have significant rights regarding your personal data. Enspira is designed to honor and facilitate these rights, whether you are a direct user of our platform or a participating user in someone else’s chatbot. The following is a summary of your rights:

- **Right to Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. For example, registered users can request a copy of their account information, chat logs, or any other personal data we have. We will provide this in a commonly used electronic format (often referred to as data portability, which we also honor to the extent required – meaning we can give you your data in a structured format that you could provide to another service if needed).

- **Right to Rectification:** If any of your personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct it. You can update certain information (like your email or profile details) directly via your account settings. For other corrections (like a chat log that you believe is recorded incorrectly), you can contact us and we will make the correction if feasible, or otherwise note the dispute.

- **Right to Deletion (Right to be Forgotten):** You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. This includes the ability to delete your entire account and all associated data. When you delete your account (or request us to do so), we will remove your personal information from our active systems. As mentioned under Data Retention, data already used in aggregate for training our AI cannot be isolated and removed from the model, but all raw personal data (account info, logs, etc.) will be deleted. We will also instruct our processors to delete your data from their systems. Keep in mind that deleting your account will typically erase all your chatbot’s logs and configurations, so this is a permanent action. For participating users (someone who doesn’t have an Enspira account but whose chats were captured), you also have the right to have your personal data removed. For example, if you chatted with someone’s Enspira bot and want your messages removed from Enspira’s storage, you can contact us and identify the relevant data (such as the Twitch channel and your username, and roughly when you chatted). We will, to the best of our ability, locate and delete or anonymize those records. There may be cases where we cannot fully delete specific messages if they are entwined with a chatbot’s overall logs in a way that is necessary for the bot owner’s legitimate interests, but generally we will seek a solution (perhaps anonymizing your username in those logs). We will explain any limitations if they arise. Note: if you are the owner of an Enspira bot and you delete a participating user’s messages upon their request, this might slightly affect any analytics or learning derived from that data, but that’s okay – honoring privacy requests comes first.

- **Right to Restrict Processing:** You have the right to ask us to restrict or pause the processing of your data in certain circumstances. For instance, if you contest the accuracy of data or have objected to processing (see below) and we are evaluating your request, you can ask that we hold the data but not process it further until resolved. Another example: if you want to use the service but don’t want your data used for AI training improvements, you could request a restriction. While we don’t currently offer a user-facing toggle for excluding your data from AI improvement (aside from opting out by not using the service), you can contact us to discuss this and we will try to accommodate reasonable requests where feasible (e.g., we could flag your account so that logs aren’t included in any future training sets).

- **Right to Object to Processing:** In certain situations, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal information. The most common case is objecting to processing based on **legitimate interests**. For example, if you are not comfortable that we use your chat logs (with PII removed) to improve our AI (a legitimate interest of ours), you can object to that. If you do, we will evaluate whether our interest in using that data is overridden by your privacy rights. Generally, we will likely honor such an objection by excluding your data from future training rounds, because we want you to feel secure using Enspira. You can also object if you believe we’re processing your data unlawfully or beyond what’s necessary. Another ground to object is direct marketing – though we do not perform direct marketing using your data, rest assured if we ever did, you could object (opt-out) at any time and we would stop. If you object to certain processing, this may lead to some features being limited (for example, if you object to us processing chat data entirely, the chatbot cannot function), but we will explain such consequences and try to find a balance.

- **Right to Withdraw Consent:** If we are processing any personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing that was done before withdrawal. For example, if you gave consent for us to feature your testimonial on our site, and later change your mind, you can withdraw consent and we will remove your testimonial and stop any further use. Since our service generally doesn’t hinge on consent (except for minors as described, or perhaps optional features), this right mainly applies to optional scenarios. One implicit consent in using the service is consenting to cookies where required – you can always manage cookies via your browser settings or any cookie banner we provide.

- **Right to Data Portability:** You have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that data to another service (or ask us to, where technically feasible). Practically, this overlaps with the Right to Access: if you request your data, we will give it to you in a convenient format (likely JSON or CSV files). This could include your account info, and raw chat logs associated with your account. If you need a specific format to import into another tool, let us know and we’ll try to accommodate.

- **Right to Non-Discrimination:** Enspira will never discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. For California residents in particular, the CCPA ensures you should receive equal service and pricing even if you exercise privacy rights. We fully agree with this principle. This means, for example, if you ask to delete your data or opt-out of any optional data use, we will not suspend your service or provide a lesser experience *just because* of that request. (The only changes will be those inherently related to fulfilling your request – e.g., if you ask us to delete all your chat logs, you obviously won’t have those logs available anymore for use – but we won’t ban you or downgrade you for making the request itself.)

- **Additional Rights for California Residents:** If you are a California resident, the CCPA (as amended by CPRA) provides specific rights which are generally covered by the above. To reiterate, you have the right to know what personal information is collected, the right to know if it’s disclosed (we’ve outlined that we don’t disclose beyond the cases listed), the right to request deletion, the right to opt-out of sale (not applicable here since we don’t sell data), the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to not be penalized for exercising rights. You also have the right to receive information about the categories of third parties we share data with (we’ve described service providers and legal recipients), and the categories of data we collect (see **Information We Collect** above). This Privacy Policy is intended to satisfy the requirement of a "Notice at Collection" and a general privacy policy under CCPA. If you need this information in an alternative format, please contact us. Also, California’s "Shine the Light" law allows residents to request certain information about our disclosure of personal info to third parties for their direct marketing in the prior year. We have nothing to disclose in that regard because we haven’t done such sharing.

- **Additional Rights for EU/EEA Residents:** If you are in the EU/EEA, in addition to the rights above, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority (DPA) if you believe we have infringed your data protection rights. We encourage you to contact us first, so we can address your concerns directly, but you always have the right to seek assistance from a regulator. We also note that under GDPR, if we were to ever perform automated decision-making (including profiling) that has legal or similarly significant effects on you, you’d have the right to not be subject to such decisions without human intervention. Enspira does not make any such automated decisions about users – our AI may make automated decisions in how it responds in chat, but those do not have legal or significant personal effects on you. They’re just conversational.

To exercise any of your rights or make any privacy-related request, please contact us at **team@enspira.tools**. We may need to verify your identity to process certain requests (for example, we might ask you to confirm from your email on file, or provide some identification, especially for access/deletion requests, to ensure that someone else isn’t trying to impersonate you). For participating users who don’t have an account, we might ask for proof that you are the owner of the account on the third-party platform (for example, we may ask you to send us a direct message from your Twitch account to verify you are the person who you claim to be who chatted with the bot). We will respond to your request as soon as possible and no later than required by applicable law. Under GDPR, we typically have one month to respond, and under CCPA, 45 days (with an extension if necessary). We will do our best to be faster than that.

There is no charge for making a reasonable request. If requests become excessive or manifestly unfounded (e.g., repeated requests without basis), we reserve the right to refuse or charge a reasonable fee as allowed by law, but we have not had to do this and hope we never will – our goal is to honor your privacy rights in a straightforward manner.

## Law Enforcement and Abuse Reporting  
Enspira takes the safety of its users and the broader community seriously. While we prioritize privacy, there are circumstances where we may need to work with law enforcement or take action to prevent harm. Here’s how we handle such situations:

- **Cooperating with Law Enforcement:** If we receive a request from law enforcement authorities (police, regulatory agencies, or via court order) for user information, our policy is to require proper legal process. This means we will insist on receiving the appropriate documentation (such as a subpoena, court order, or warrant) **before** disclosing any user data, unless there is an imminent risk of serious harm where the law permits emergency disclosure. We carefully review each request to ensure it is valid, scoped correctly, and complies with the law. If a request is overly broad, we will challenge or seek clarification to protect user privacy. For example, a request that asks for "all chat data for all users" would be rejected as inappropriate. We only provide the minimum data necessary to comply with the request. 

- **Notice to Users:** Our general practice is to notify affected users when their information is being sought by law enforcement, **unless we are legally prohibited from doing so**. For instance, if we receive a court order and there is no gag order attached, we will attempt to contact the user (using their registered email or other provided contact) to inform them and, if appropriate, give them a chance to contest the request themselves. The exception is if notifying the user is forbidden (e.g., the request comes with a non-disclosure order) or if we determine that providing notice could be counterproductive (for example, in an emergency where someone’s life or safety is at stake). In those rare cases, we might delay notice until the restriction is lifted or the emergency has passed.

- **Illegal Activities and Content:** Enspira has zero tolerance for certain abuses of its platform. If we detect or become aware of users engaging in **illegal activities** or serious violations using our service, we will take action which could include reporting to authorities. This encompasses things like child sexual abuse (CSA) material, human trafficking, credible threats of violence, terrorism-related content, non-consensual intimate imagery (revenge porn), egregious harassment or stalking, impersonation with intent to defraud or defame, and distribution of illegal content or hate speech. For example, if our systems or moderators come across child exploitation content in a chat log, we will suspend the account and report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement agency (and to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, as required by U.S. law). Similarly, if someone is using an Enspira bot to impersonate and slander another individual, we may disable the bot and provide relevant logs to authorities if a formal investigation begins. We will do this in compliance with applicable laws and with great care – we are not broadly monitoring user content, but if something egregious comes to our attention, we will respond accordingly.

- **Protecting Enspira and Others:** We may also share information with law enforcement or relevant third parties when necessary to protect our rights, property, and safety, or that of our users or others. For example, if someone threatens the Enspira platform (like attempting to hack our servers or attack our staff), or if someone is posting content that threatens violence in a public forum we service, we may proactively refer those matters to law enforcement. Another scenario could be handling fraud – if someone uses a stolen credit card to buy a subscription, we might share information with law enforcement or the card network during the investigation of that fraud.

All such actions are taken in line with our **Terms of Service** and this Privacy Policy. We document any disclosures made for legal or safety purposes. If you have any questions about how we handle law enforcement requests or reporting of abuse, you can contact us for more information. We aim to be as transparent as possible without compromising ongoing investigations or safety.

## Transparency  
Transparency is a core value for Enspira. We want users to trust that their data isn’t being secretly accessed by governments or other entities without their knowledge. To that end, we include a **warrant canary** in our policy as a way to inform you about government data requests in a manner allowed by law.

As of the date of this Privacy Policy, **Enspira has never received any secret government request for user data**. This includes, for example, National Security Letters or orders under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that come with a gag order. A **warrant canary** is a statement that will be removed if we ever do receive such secret requests. 

Enspira has **not** received any national security letters, FISA orders, or any other classified requests for user information from any government or law enforcement authority as of the latest update of this Privacy Policy. 

We update our policies periodically. If this statement disappears from future versions of our Privacy Policy, it will be a signal (to those who are familiar with this concept) that Enspira *may have been compelled to produce user data under a secret order*. We cannot lawfully promise to alert you in any other way if we receive a gagged request, so the warrant canary is our way of maintaining transparency within the bounds of the law. 

Enspira also issues transparency reports (or may do so in the future) summarizing the volume and type of government requests we receive (if any). In any given period, if we receive no requests, we might simply restate this canary or indicate zero requests. If we do receive requests that are not secret, we will disclose statistics about them (e.g., number of subpoenas, the jurisdiction, and whether we provided data). For secret requests, the removal of the canary will be the only clue, as permitted by law.

We hope we never have to remove the warrant canary. It exists to reassure you that "no news is good news." Please note, the warrant canary only covers secret requests. Routine law enforcement requests (like a normal subpoena in a criminal case) are not secret and would not cause the canary’s removal — those we handle as described in the Law Enforcement section above, usually with notice to the user.

## International Data Transfers  
Enspira is a global service – no matter where you are located, you can use our platform. Our servers and team, however, may be based in multiple countries (currently, our primary operations are in the United States). This means that **your personal data may be transferred to, and stored or processed in, a country different from your own**.

If you are located in the European Union (EU), United Kingdom, or another region with data transfer restrictions, we take steps to ensure that your data protection rights continue to be upheld even when your data crosses borders:

- **Adequacy and Safeguards:** Whenever we transfer personal data out of the EU/EEA, we ensure an adequate level of protection by using legal mechanisms approved under GDPR. The main mechanism we rely on is the European Commission’s **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**, which are contractual commitments between us (the data exporter) and the receiving party (e.g., our U.S. servers or any service provider) that require the recipient to protect EU personal data to the GDPR standard. These SCCs have been pre-approved by the EU Commission as a valid data transfer safeguard. In some cases, we may also rely on the fact that certain providers are in countries that have an "adequacy decision" from the EU (meaning the EU has determined that country’s laws offer sufficient data protection – for example, if any of our processing ever occurs in a country like Canada or Japan, which have adequacy status).

- **Supplementary Measures:** In addition to SCCs, we apply technical measures such as encryption (as described in Data Security) which ensure that even if data is stored in another country, it remains protected against unauthorized access. For instance, encryption keys stay under our control, so even cloud staff in another country can’t read the encrypted personal data.

- **Transparency in Location:** Currently, if your data is stored or accessible in the United States, it’s subject to U.S. laws (which is why we maintain the Warrant Canary for transparency around U.S. government requests). Users outside the U.S. should be aware that data privacy laws in the U.S. or other countries may differ from those in your jurisdiction. However, our commitment is that your data will always be handled in line with this Privacy Policy and the stringent standards of GDPR, regardless of where it is processed.

- **By using Enspira, you acknowledge** that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this policy, which could be located in different jurisdictions. We will always ensure such transfers are lawful. If at any time we cannot guarantee this (for example, if legal frameworks change), we will halt transfers or seek your consent where required.

If you have questions about cross-border data handling, or need more specifics about where your data might be stored or accessible, please contact us. We can provide more details (e.g., if we introduce servers in Europe or Asia, we’ll let you know and update this section).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of the policy. For significant changes, we will also provide a more prominent notice – for example, by emailing registered users or by placing a notice on our website or dashboard.

Significant changes might include things like: expanding the types of data we collect, changes in how we use data, selling or merging our company, or any practice that would be materially different from what we’ve described here. Minor changes (like clarifications or grammatical fixes) may occur without broad notification, but you can always see the history via the date.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. If you continue to use Enspira after a revised Privacy Policy has been posted, it means you accept the changes. (If a change required fresh consent by law, we would of course obtain that separately.)

If you do not agree with any aspect of the updated Privacy Policy, you should discontinue use of our services and you may request deletion of your data as described above.

## Contact Us  
Your privacy and trust matter to us. If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or how Enspira handles your data, please contact us:

**Email:** team@enspira.tools  

We prefer email communication for privacy inquiries – it helps us track and address your concerns promptly. When you contact us, please provide as much detail as possible about your question or request, without sharing sensitive information unnecessarily. We may need to verify your identity for certain requests (as noted in **Your Rights**), but we will guide you through that if needed.

At this time, Enspira has not formally appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Given the size and nature of our operations, a DPO is not legally required. However, we have a dedicated privacy team that will be happy to assist you. In the absence of a DPO, our team at the above contact is responsible for overseeing privacy compliance and responding to data protection concerns. If our company grows to a point where appointing a DPO becomes necessary or beneficial, we will update this policy with their contact information.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, as mentioned earlier (for EU users, that would be your national Data Protection Authority; for UK users, the ICO; for others, an equivalent body or your local regulator). We sincerely hope that we can address any issue you have directly, but that avenue is always available to you.

Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. We’ve tried to balance transparency, friendliness, and thorough legal compliance in this document. We are committed to protecting your privacy while providing a fun and engaging AI chatbot experience. If anything in this Policy is unclear, please reach out – we’re here to help and listen. Your use of Enspira is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. We appreciate your trust in Enspira for your chatbot needs, and we will continue working hard to deserve that trust every day.
