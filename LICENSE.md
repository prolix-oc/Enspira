# Enspira Research License (Version 1.0)

---

*Effective Date: March 28, 2025*

*Plain-Language Preamble:* The Enspira Research License is a custom source-available license that allows you to view, use, and modify the Enspira platform for personal, academic, and non-profit research purposes, while protecting the project from unauthorized commercial or governmental exploitation. In essence, you can use Enspira freely for yourself or your non-profit organization, and you can fork or modify it internally. However, you **must** contribute back any improvements you make, and you **cannot** redistribute the software or deploy it publicly — only the project founder and the Enspira organization can release or host Enspira for public use. Commercial (for-profit) use is not covered by this license and requires a separate arrangement. Likewise, no government agency can use Enspira officially. This license also forbids use of the Enspira name or logo without permission. The goal is to keep Enspira open and accessible to align with the ideology that software is a human right for end-users, while ensuring community enhancements are shared and preventing companies from taking advantage of the software without contributing. The following terms are the legally binding conditions of the Enspira Research License:

## 1. **Definitions**  
For purposes of this License, the following terms have the meanings given:  

- **"Improvements"** refers to any changes in the code base that alter, in either a significant or insignificant way, the original source code. **This can include, but is not limited to**: alterations to execution flow, use of a new module, any insertion or changes to core modules, or the addition of extensions that enable communications to external platforms or utilities.
- **"Software"** refers to the Enspira platform, including its source code, documentation, and any associated materials made available under this License.  
- **"Licensor"** refers to the copyright holder(s) offering the Software under this License. Initially, the Licensor is the Enspira project founder, Darran Hall (also known as **Prolix OCs**), and the Enspira organization authorized by him.  
- **"Licensee"** or **"You"** means the individual or legal entity exercising the permissions granted by this License.  
- **"Contributor"** means any individual or entity (including the Licensor and others) that submits or has submitted any modifications, enhancements, or other contributions to the Software that are accepted into the official codebase by the Licensor.  
- **"Personal Use"** means use of the Software by an individual solely for personal, private, and non-commercial purposes (which may include personal education or experimentation).  
- **"Non-Profit Organization"** means an entity that is not operated for profit, including charitable organizations qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and similar organizations worldwide (such as educational or research institutions that are not-for-profit). **"Non-Profit Use"** means use of the Software by a Non-Profit Organization for its non-commercial activities.  
- **"Internal Use"** means use of the Software within a single organization (which may be a for-profit company, non-profit, or academic institution) solely for that organization’s own internal research, development, or operations, and not to provide services or capabilities to any external party. Internal Use includes allowing access to the Software by employees or contractors of the organization strictly for internal purposes.  
- **"Public Use"** (or **"Public-Facing Use"**) means any use of the Software that intentionally makes the Software, or any of its functionality, accessible to any person or entity other than You or your internal organizational users. This includes, but is not limited to, making the Software available through a website, API, cloud or SaaS platform, or as part of any product or service that is accessible to customers, users, or the general public outside your organization.  
- **"Commercial Use"** means any use of the Software that is intended for commercial gain or advantage, or any use by a for-profit entity **outside** of Internal Use.  In particular, Commercial Use includes, without limitation: (i) using the Software as part of services provided to third parties (whether paid or unpaid); (ii) using the Software to develop or operate a product for sale, license, or external deployment; or (iii) any deployment or use of the Software that is part of revenue-generating activities. (For the avoidance of doubt, use of the Software solely for Internal Use by a for-profit business, without providing the Software or its output to any third party, is **not** considered Commercial Use under this License.)  
- **"Government Entity"** means any government, governmental agency, department, office, or instrumentality at any level (municipal, state/provincial, national/federal, or supranational), as well as any organization acting on behalf of such an entity.  

## 2. **Grant of License and Permitted Uses**  
Subject to your compliance with **all** terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to use, reproduce, and modify the Software, **solely** for the following permitted purposes (collectively, "Permitted Uses"):  

  a. **Personal Use** – You may use, run, and modify the Software for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.  
  b. **Non-Profit Use** – If you are a Non-Profit Organization (or an individual using the Software for non-profit academic or research purposes), you may use, run, and modify the Software for your organization’s internal, non-commercial activities.  
  c. **Internal Use (Including Internal Corporate Use)** – You may use, run, and modify the Software within your organization for internal development, testing, and operations. This includes for-profit companies using the Software internally (for example, for internal research or to assist in internal business functions), **provided** such use is not a Public Use and not part of providing services or products to any third party.  

**No Distribution Rights:** This License **does not** grant you any right to distribute, publish, or make available copies of the Software or any modified version of the Software to **any** other party. Except for sharing within your own organization for Internal Use, you may not transfer, sublicense, rent, sell, lease, or otherwise convey the Software (or any portion of it) to anyone else. The source code may be publicly visible in the official Enspira repository, but You are not licensed to redistribute it yourself. **All distribution rights are reserved to the Licensor (the Enspira organization and its founder)**. The Licensor is the only party authorized to release or distribute the Software (including any modified versions) to the public.  

**All Other Rights Reserved:** Any use of the Software outside the scope of these Permitted Uses (and outside the other express terms of this License) is prohibited. All rights not expressly granted to You in this License are reserved by the Licensor. You acquire no rights or licenses to the Software other than those expressly granted herein. You may not sublicense, transfer, or assign this License to any third party. This License also does not limit the Licensor’s right to offer the Software under different terms (or to refuse contributions or usage from any party in violation of these terms).

## 3. **Contribution of Modifications and Improvements**  
If You modify, improve, extend, or otherwise change the Software, or create any derivative works based on the Software, **and** those changes enhance or add to the functionality or performance of the Software (collectively, "Improvements"), You are **obligated** to contribute those Improvements back to the official Enspira project as outlined below:

- **3.1 Requirement to Contribute Back:** As a condition of this License, You must submit or offer all Improvements to the Licensor for potential incorporation into the official Software repository. Typically, this can be done by making a good-faith attempt to submit a merge request or pull request to the official Enspira source code repository (or by another method designated by the Enspira organization). You should contribute such Improvements in a timely manner after developing them (generally, no later than 30 days after the Improvement is functional), and You may continue to use your modified version **only** so long as you are in compliance with this contribution requirement. If You choose not to contribute your Improvements as required, or if you do not wish to have them governed by this License, then you do not have the right to deploy or use those Improvements beyond what this License allows (i.e., you may need to cease using your modified version or obtain a separate license). The intent of this section is to ensure that the community benefits from all enhancements and that no functional improvement is kept proprietary.  

- **3.2 License and Copyright for Contributions:** By submitting an Improvement to the Licensor (for example, via a pull request) or by allowing it to be integrated into the Software, You agree to license your contribution under the terms of this Enspira Research License. You retain copyright ownership of your contributions, but you hereby grant the Licensor and all other Licensees a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your contributed code as part of the Software under this License. Once accepted by the Licensor, any contributed Improvement will become part of the Software and will be made source-available under this same License. You may not submit contributions under any other license or terms; all contributions to Enspira must be provided under the Enspira Research License to ensure consistency and source availability.

- **3.3 No Proprietary or Restricted Code:** You agree that you will **not** contribute any code, library, dataset, or other content to the Software that (a) is encumbered by patents, copyrights, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights of a third party **without** appropriate authorization or licensing; (b) is subject to any license terms (including your own proprietary terms or open-source licenses) that would require, as a condition of use, modification, or distribution of such contribution, compliance with terms incompatible with this License; or (c) would otherwise place the Enspira project or its users at legal risk or under additional restrictions. In short, **no contribution may "poison" the codebase** with patent traps or conflicting licenses. By contributing, You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to submit the contribution and to license it under these terms, and that to the best of your knowledge, your contribution does not infringe or misappropriate anyone else’s rights and will not require any additional license or fee for the Enspira project or its users to use. If You are aware of any patents (yours or third-party) that **might** read on your contribution, You agree to disclose this in the contribution notes.

- **3.4 Disclaimer for Unaccepted Contributions:** Simply submitting an Improvement via pull request or other means does not guarantee that the Licensor will accept or merge it. The Licensor has sole discretion over which contributions are integrated into the official project. If your Improvements are not accepted, you are still bound by the non-distribution terms of this License — you may use your variant internally under this License, but you **may not distribute or deploy it publicly** (unless you obtain a separate license or permission). Unaccepted improvements therefore remain subject to the same use restrictions (no external use, no commercial use, etc.) as the original Software. You are encouraged to work with the maintainers to get Improvements accepted rather than maintaining significant private forks.

*(In summary: if you improve Enspira, you must try to contribute those improvements back under this license. All contributed code will become part of the open codebase if accepted. Don’t contribute anything that brings legal baggage (like patent issues or conflicting licenses) into the project.)* 

## 4. **No Unauthorized Distribution or Public Deployment**  
**4.1 No Redistribution:** Except as expressly allowed for Contributions (per Section 3.1) or internal sharing within your organization, You may not distribute, publish, release, or disseminate the Software or any derivative works of the Software to any third party. This prohibition on distribution applies to both source code and compiled/object code forms, and it includes uploading the Software to any public repository or package manager that is not controlled by the Licensor. In short, you are not allowed to re-post the code or binaries publicly, include it in any open source project release of your own, or otherwise share it outside the bounds of your own personal or internal use. The **exclusive** right to distribute the Software (or to authorize distribution) belongs to the Licensor (Darran Hall and the Enspira organization). 

**4.2 No Public-Facing Service/Deployment:** You are expressly **forbidden** from making the Software available for use by anyone other than yourself or your Internal Users. This means You **cannot** deploy or use the Software in any public-facing or externally accessible manner — for example, you may not host a website or service powered by Enspira for users outside your organization; you may not offer Enspira as a service (SaaS) or otherwise enable others to use or interact with Enspira functionality over a network; and you may not integrate Enspira into a product (open-source or proprietary) that is distributed to or accessible by third parties. Any such public deployment or external availability of the Software is a violation of this License. The only entities permitted to deploy or offer Enspira to the public (whether free or for a fee) are the Licensor and those specifically authorized in writing by the Licensor. If you have improvements or features you wish to see in a public Enspira service, you are encouraged to contribute them to the official project rather than running your own public instance.

**4.3 Internal Use Sharing:** *Clarification:* If you are using the Software internally (e.g., within a company or research lab), you may allow access to the Software by your colleagues, employees, or contractors as needed for that internal use, and you may share modified versions with them, **provided** this remains solely within your organization and they are bound to respect the terms of this License. Such internal sharing is not considered "distribution" for the purposes of this License. However, you must ensure that anyone within your organization who receives a copy of the Software or modified Software is made aware of, and agrees to abide by, the terms of this License (including the prohibition on further distribution and the requirement to keep changes under this License). If you provide any portion of the Software to your internal team, you should include a copy of this License and any relevant copyright notices.

**4.4 No Removal of Notices:** You must not remove or alter any copyright, author attribution, or license notices that are included with the Software. All copies of the Software, including any modified versions or portions you retain for Internal Use, must retain any existing notices (e.g., copyright statements) and a copy of this License text. This ensures that anyone interacting with the code is aware of its license and origin.  

## 5. **Commercial Use Restrictions and Separate Licensing**  
**5.1 Non-Commercial Only (Default):** This License allows **only** non-commercial usage of the Software (except for limited internal business use as outlined). **Any** use of the Software that is commercial in nature or for-profit, except purely internal use, is **not** permitted under these terms. If You are an individual or entity intending to use the Software in a revenue-generating context, or as part of providing goods or services for a fee (or as part of your business offerings even if provided for free), you do **not** have rights to do so under this License *without explicit permission*. 

**5.2 Separate Commercial License Required:** If You (or your company) wish to use the Software for **commercial purposes** or any other use that falls outside the Permitted Uses of Section 2, You must obtain a separate commercial license or written permission from the Licensor. This includes (but is not limited to) using Enspira as part of a product offering, incorporating Enspira into a proprietary software solution that is sold or licensed, using Enspira to provide services or SaaS to third parties, or deploying Enspira in any customer-facing capacity. To inquire about a commercial or special license, contact the Enspira team at **team@enspira.tools**. The terms of such a commercial license (including fees, royalties, or other conditions) will be determined between You and the Licensor outside of this Enspira Research License.

**5.3 Fair Internal Use vs. Commercial Exploitation:** For the avoidance of doubt, **Internal Use by a for-profit entity** (for example, using Enspira internally to analyze data or improve your business’s operations) is permitted without a separate license, as long as the use remains entirely internal and not part of providing a service/product to others. This allowance is made in the spirit of research and innovation. However, if your internal use of Enspira is a precursor to or part of a plan to offer a product or service externally, or otherwise to derive direct commercial benefit from Enspira, you should reach out to the Licensor for a proper license. The Licensor reserves the right to determine what constitutes Commercial Use and may offer custom licensing to accommodate innovative uses that benefit both the user and the community.

**5.4 No Franchise or Multiparty Use:** You may not circumvent the intent of this section by, for example, forming a nonprofit or intermediary solely to provide Enspira to a commercial entity, or by having an affiliated entity use Enspira internally and then pass results to a commercial affiliate. Such stratagems will be considered a violation of the non-commercial restriction. Any arrangement in which a third party (other than the Licensor or an authorized party) benefits from Enspira in a commercial context is disallowed unless separately licensed.

*(In summary: If you want to do anything commercial with Enspira – whether running it as a service, embedding it in a product you sell, or any for-profit use beyond internal R&D – you need to get permission and likely pay for a commercial license. Enspira is free for personal and non-profit use, not for companies to monetize without contributing.)* 

## 6. **No Government Use**  
**6.1 Prohibition on Government Institution Use:** The use of the Software by any Government Entity (as defined in Section 1) in an official or institutional capacity is **expressly prohibited** under this License. This means no national government, state or provincial government, city or local government, or any of their agencies, departments, or subdivisions may use, deploy, copy, or modify the Software as part of their official functions, operations, or services. The License is not intended for governmental use, and no license rights are granted for such use. 

**6.2 No Acquisition on Behalf of Government:** You represent and warrant that you are not a Government Entity, and you are not obtaining or using the Software on behalf of or at the direction of any Government Entity. You further agree that you will not transfer or provide access to the Software to any Government Entity. Use of the Software, even if publicly available, by any Government Entity is considered an unlicensed (and unauthorized) use and is a violation of these terms.

**6.3 Personal Use by Government Employees:** Notwithstanding the above, an individual who is an employee or officer of a Government Entity may download, install, or use the Software for their **own Personal Use** (for example, on a personal computer at home, for personal research or learning), as long as such use is wholly outside the scope of their official duties and not on behalf of the Government Entity. Such personal usage by government personnel is subject to all the same terms and restrictions of this License and confers no rights to the Government Entity itself. If you are a government employee, you must ensure that you are acting in a private capacity when using the Software and not violating any policies of your employer by doing so.

**6.4 Exception by Licensor Approval:** The only circumstance in which Government Entity use is allowed is if the Licensor provides a separate written license or permission explicitly for that Government Entity. Such permission would be given at the sole discretion of the Licensor and would likely include additional terms or limitations. Without such explicit permission, any governmental use is unlicensed.

*(In plain terms: No government agency or office is allowed to use Enspira under this license. Enspira is meant for the public and academia, not for government projects, unless the founder explicitly agrees otherwise. Government employees can tinker with it personally at home, but they can’t bring it to work or use it for their government job.)* 

## 7. **No Trademark or Branding Rights**  
This License does **not** grant You any rights to use the names, trademarks, service marks, or logos associated with the Enspira project or the Licensor (including "Enspira" and "Prolix OCs"). You may not use "Enspira" or any confusingly similar name for a fork, derivative project, or any software based on the Software without prior written permission from the Licensor. You also may not claim or imply endorsement by, or partnership with, the official Enspira project or the Licensor without permission.

Specifically:  

- You shall not use the term "Enspira" as part of the name of any modified version of the Software that you make for internal use, nor for any software or service you create that is related to the Software. When referring to your modifications internally or in contributed code, you should maintain attribution to the original project (for example, "based on Enspira") but not misrepresent your version as the official Enspira.  
- You shall not use any Enspira logos, graphics, or trademarks in your own project’s branding, marketing, or documentation, except to truthfully state that your work is derived from or compatible with Enspira (and such statements should include a disclaimer that you are **not** the official Enspira provider).  
- All goodwill associated with the "Enspira" name and trademarks remains with the Licensor. Misuse of the Licensor’s marks will be considered a breach of this License. If you have questions about acceptable use of Enspira’s name or branding (for example, academic papers or comparisons), please contact the Licensor for guidance.

*(In short: You can talk about Enspira and factually state your code is based on it, but you cannot brand your project or service with the Enspira name or logos. Only the official Enspira organization can use that branding.)* 

## 8. **Patent License and Patent Claims**  
**8.1 Patent License from Licensor:** The Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license under any patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that would be infringed by your use of the unmodified Software as permitted by this License. This means the Licensor promises not to sue You for patent infringement for using the Software as allowed, and You are allowed to use any patented technology that is part of the Software. This patent license extends only to the Software as provided by the Licensor (and Contributions accepted into the Software), and not to any modifications or combinations you may make that include additional technology not part of the Software.

**8.2 Patent License from Contributors:** Similarly, each Contributor to the Software, by contributing and having their contribution accepted into the codebase, grants to all Licensees a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license under any patent claims owned or controlled by that Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the contribution itself or by the combination of that contribution with the rest of the Software. This ensures that no Contributor (including the Licensor, in their role as a Contributor for new code) can submit code and later exercise a patent to block its use. If a Contributor is not authorized to grant such patent license for any part of their contribution, they should not contribute that part.

**8.3 Patent Non-Assertion/Termination:** If You (or any party affiliated with You, such as a company you control) initiate a lawsuit or any legal proceeding (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) against the Licensor, any Contributor, or any other Licensee of the Software, alleging that the Software (or any portion of it) infringes a patent that You own or control, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License (by any party) shall terminate as of the date such claim is filed. In plain terms, **you cannot both use this Software and sue the project or its users for patent infringement regarding this Software**. This clause is intended to protect the community from patent aggression. The termination in this section is automatic and self-executing; no further action by the Licensor or any Contributor is required to effect it.

**8.4 No Patent Warranty:** The Licensor and Contributors do **not** guarantee that the Software is free of third-party patent claims. While each Contributor promises not to sue Licensees for patents they hold, it’s possible that third parties not involved in the project may have patent rights that cover aspects of the Software. (See Section 10 regarding disclaimer of liability for such issues.) You are responsible for using the Software in compliance with applicable patent laws. However, should the Licensor become aware of a third-party patent that plausibly reads on the Software, the Licensor may at its discretion attempt to remove or re-engineer the affected component in future releases.

## 9. **Disclaimer of Warranty**  
**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.** THE LICENSOR, CONTRIBUTORS, AND AFFILIATED PARTIES **EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS**, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING (BUT NOT limited to) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, **NON-INFRINGEMENT** of intellectual property rights, **SYSTEM INTEGRATION**, or **ACCURACY**. You accept the Software with all faults and without any warranty that it will meet your needs or expectations, that it will be error-free or uninterrupted, or that any defects can or will be corrected. **No oral or written information or advice** given by the Licensor or any of its agents shall create any warranty. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Software is with You, the user.

*(This means that you cannot hold the Licensor or contributors responsible if the Software doesn’t work as intended, or if it has bugs, or if it infringes someone else’s IP, etc. You use it at your own risk.)*

## 10. **Limitation of Liability**  
To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, in no event will the Licensor or any Contributor be liable to You for any damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with this License or the use or performance of the Software, **even if** the Licensor or Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to: **direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages**, also including (without limitation) damages for loss of profits or revenue, business interruption, loss of data, procurement of substitute goods or services, or any claims by third parties. 

The Licensor and Contributors shall not be liable for any claim, whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other theory of liability, related to or arising from the Software or use of the Software. This limitation of liability applies to any and all causes of action, whether for breach of contract, breach of warranty, indemnification, infringement, or otherwise. 

By using the Software, You acknowledge that the Licensor is **not responsible** if the Software fails or if its use causes any harm or loss. Specifically, You agree that the Licensor and Contributors will **not** be liable for any legal or financial consequences resulting from claims of intellectual property infringement (including patent infringement) brought against You by third parties due to your use of the Software. You are solely responsible for compliance with any laws and for any damage that results from your actions in connection with the Software.

*(In short: You can’t recover any damages from the Licensor or contributors. If something goes wrong or someone sues you because you used this Software, that’s on you, not on us.)*

## 11. **Termination**  
**11.1 Termination for Violation:** This License and all rights granted to You under it terminate automatically if You violate any material term of the License. For example (and not limited to): if You use the Software in an unauthorized commercial way, fail to contribute required improvements, publicly deploy or distribute the Software without permission, or use it in a forbidden governmental or public-facing capacity, You are in breach of this License. Upon breach, You must immediately cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in your possession or control (including any modified versions). 

**11.2 Notice and Cure (Opportunity to Comply):** As an exception to the automatic termination rule, if this is your first breach of the License and You receive written notice from the Licensor of the violation, You will have a period of **30 days** from receipt of notice to come back into full compliance with the License. During that period, your License is suspended, not terminated, and it will fully resume (as if no breach had occurred) only if: (a) You correct the violation and cease the offending conduct, and (b) You take concrete steps to remedy any harm caused by the violation (for example, if you improperly deployed the Software publicly, you withdraw it and ensure any recipients are informed it was unlicensed; if you failed to contribute changes, you submit them; etc.). If You do not cure the breach within the 30-day period, then your License **permanently terminates** on the 31st day after notice. The cure provision applies only to the first noticed breach; any subsequent breach by You may result in immediate termination without opportunity to cure.

**11.3 Effect of Termination:** Upon termination of this License for any reason, You must stop all use of the Software and refrain from any further use. Any provisions of this License which by their nature should survive termination (such as disclaimers of warranty, limitations of liability, and any perpetual licenses granted by You to the Licensor and others for your contributions, as well as the prohibition on unauthorized use or distribution of the Software) shall continue in effect. Termination of the License does not relieve You of liability for violations occurring before the License was terminated.

**11.4 No Refunds/No Reinstatement:** Since the Software is provided free of charge under this License (for permitted uses), there is nothing to refund upon termination. Termination is without prejudice to any rights the Licensor may have to seek legal remedies for unauthorized use that occurred prior to termination. The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, reinstate a terminated License if it determines that you have sufficiently corrected past violations, but is under no obligation to do so.

## 12. **General Provisions**  
**12.1 Governing Law:** This License is an intellectual property license, and not a contract signed by both parties; however, to the extent any dispute arises out of or in connection with this License, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the laws of the jurisdiction of the Licensor’s principal place of business (currently, the United States) shall apply, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. If required, the controlling language of the License is English, and any translations are provided for convenience only.

**12.2 Severability:** If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision shall be reformed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the greatest extent possible under law, and the remaining provisions of this License shall continue in full force and effect. If such reformation is not possible, the invalid provision shall be deemed severed from this License, but this License shall otherwise remain in force.

**12.3 No Waiver:** No failure or delay by the Licensor in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this License shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. A waiver by the Licensor of any provision, or of any breach by You, shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or any subsequent breach of the same provision. All waivers must be in a signed writing to be effective.

**12.4 No Partnership or Agency:** This License does not create any partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between You and the Licensor. You are using the Software as an independent party and are not authorized to make any statements, representations, or commitments on behalf of the Licensor. You agree not to represent yourself as an agent or representative of Enspira or the Licensor to any third party.

**12.5 Entire License:** This License constitutes the entire and only agreement between the Licensor and You concerning the Software (subject to any separate written agreements for commercial or government use as discussed). It supersedes any prior proposals, agreements, or communications relating to the Software. The Licensor may publish updated or revised versions of this License from time to time, but such changes will not retroactively affect any rights already granted under this version unless You choose to adopt a new version by upgrading your copy of the Software or contributing code under the new version.

**12.6 Acceptance:** By exercising any permissions granted by this License (for example, by downloading, using, or modifying the Software), You indicate your acceptance of these terms and conditions. If You do not agree to all the terms, you have no license to use the Software.
